In this project, we building an exclusive clubhouse where a member can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.
 - First task was creating the User model and the validations for name and email
 - We added a sign in functionality
 - We added session and cookies to store user identity
